makedvd 1.0
===========

A little script to make a burnable DVD (i.e., a VIDEO_TS directory) from demuxed .m2v and .m1a files.

Note that the resulting DVD will not have any menu. It will just be the stream you pumped into the script, playable on your average DVD player.

Make sure to have at least 3 times as much free space on your harddrive as the two files are taking up.

Prerequisites
-------------
*  A software to make .m2v and .m1a files. Such files can, for example, be generated by processing a .ts file recorded with a digital PVR with [MPEG Streamclip](http://www.squared5.com/). Just demux the stream into .m2v and .m1a.
* [mplex](http://mjpeg.sourceforge.net/)
* [dvdauthor](http://dvdauthor.sourceforge.net/). Both mplex and dvdauthor can be installed via [MacPorts](http://www.macports.org/).

Usage
-----
`makedvd filename`

will process the files `filename.m2v` and `filename.m1a` and eventually create a directory called `DVDfilename` for you to burn to a DVD.
